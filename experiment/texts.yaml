instructions:
  1: >
    Welcome to the experiment! Today we will testing how quickly you can
    detect a target presented either to the left or the right of where you are
    looking. You can see an example of the target below. The target is the
    gray circle, and it will flash in either the left or the right frame. If
    it appears on the left, press the left arrow key. If it appears on the
    right, press the right arrow key. Press the arrow key corresponding to the
    location of the target below.
  2: >
    Before the target appears, you will see an arrow or a word in the center,
    between the frames. Please pay attention to these cues, as they may help
    you find the target, but occasionally they will mislead you. No matter
    what cue you see, your task is the same: to identify where you saw the
    target. Press the SPACEBAR to continue.
